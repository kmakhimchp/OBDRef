  BLE GAP Header File

  Company:
    Microchip Technology Inc.

  File Name:
    ble_gap.h

  Summary:
    This header file provides the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Generic Access 
    Profile (GAP) interface functions for application developers.


  Description:
    This header file defines the interface for the BLE GAP functions and events 
    that application developers can use. The "BLE_GAP_Init" function must be 
    called within the "APP_Initialize" function to set up the GAP module within 
    the system. This initialization is crucial for the proper functioning of the 
    BLE application.
